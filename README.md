# Movie Search App 


### English

![Made with React](https://shields.io/badge/made%20with-React-lightblue?logo=react&style=plastic)
![Made with Sass](https://shields.io/badge/made%20with-Sass-ff69b4?logo=sass&style=plastic)

This is my last project of the Bootcamp ADA ITW. I was given [this page](https://app-movie-jonhks.herokuapp.com/) as a model with the posibility to change styles.
I implemented this libraries:

- [swiper](https://swiperjs.com/)
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) 
- [react router dom](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [react icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [and this amazing code](https://github.com/wrongakram/sass-mediaqueries/blob/master/src/breakpoints/breakpoints.scss) for the brealpoints

And [The Movie Data Base API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=es)

The page is in german, and most of the information (movies overviews, titles) too, with some exceptions that the API didn't provide so I chose English as a second option. Some of the titles are written in their original language. 
Check the [site here](https://infokleinkino.netlify.app/)
